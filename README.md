# Serial Interval Estimation
*Application of package **siestim***



This repository is to complement the paper titled **A method to estimate the serial interval distribution under partially-sampled data** which is written by K. Susvitasari, P. Tupper, J. Stockdale, and C. Colijn. It contains R scripts to reproduce the analysis and figures, and the results of the simulations in the paper. 

The repository is centred around the application of the package "siestim" which is accessible in https://github.com/ksusvita92/siestim. For instructions to download the package, please visit the link. 



## Contents

+ **R**: a collection of R scripts to reproduce analysis and figures in the paper. It contains the following subfolders:
  + **Figure**: scripts to reproduce all figures
  + **Real Outbreak Analysis**: the implementation of *siestim* on the real-life outbreaks
  + **Distribution-based Simulation**: scripts to perform the simulations; i.e. the first and second experiment
  + **SIR Simulation**: scripts to perform SIR outbreak simulation; script called *tryme.R* provides a tutorial to run this simulation
+ **Data**: data sets of symptom onset difference for each outbreak and the transmission networks of the COVID-19 and MERS data sets.
+ **figure**: scripts to reproduce some figures in the paper.
+ **Result**: results of the simulation studies and the outbreak analysis.
